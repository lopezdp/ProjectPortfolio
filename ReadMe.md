# Project Portfolio

This is my **Project Portfolio**. The **index.html** file is the initial page to load as the **index.html** file is the default file loaded by the web servers when stored in the public_html folders on Host Gator or any other hosting site where a web page is deployed.

This portfolio is meant to showcase some of my favorite projects to potential employers and customers who would like me to join their team as a *Software Engineer*.

## Running the Webpage

From Github, clone or download the repository and its associated file structure to any directory you wish to save it on. Double click on the **index.html** file to open the file in a browser or use the following instruction to display in the browser of your choice:

#### Windows

Open a browser window and enter the following information into the address bar:

* file:///C:/PATH/lopezdp.github.io/index.html

#### MacOS

Open a browser window and enter the following information into the address bar:

## Issues & Future Functionality

1. The **References** button will be updated at a later date when my references send me their letters.

2. I would like to add a custom form attached to a PostgreSQL database to collect data from visitors who want to contact me.

3. I would like to redeploy the page using the Express.js framework to load the information and semantic **HTML** dynamically.
